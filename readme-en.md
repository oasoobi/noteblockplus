# Add-on to display the scale of a sound block
[Download the latest version](https://github.com/oasoobi/noteblockplus/releases/latest/download/noteblockplus.mcpack)

## Caution: 
When creating a world, the Beta APIs must be enabled before adding the add-on. Holiday Creator Futures must be enabled as well.
## How to use:

Take a note stick from your creative inventory.

When sneaked, click on the note block to check the scale without changing it. 

If you are not sneaking, you can view the scale after it has been changed.
