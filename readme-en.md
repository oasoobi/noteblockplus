## Caution:
When creating a world, the Beta APIs must be enabled before adding the add-on. Holiday Creator Futures must be enabled as well.
## How to use:


Take a note stick from your creative inventory.


Squat down and click on the note stick to check the scale without changing it.


If you are not crouching, you can view the scale after it has been changed.
